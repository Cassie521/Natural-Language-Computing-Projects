# Natural-Language-Computing-Projects
This repository contain the projects that are relevant to the natural language computing / processing field. The project topics include but not limited to sentiment analysis, statistical & neural machine translation, and speech recognition analytics, etc. 

Considering some projects are course projects and the restriction of sharing those files as public, I will make the codes as private but I will give descriptions (Context + Mehodology + Result) for each project.
